# WordleGame

 In this code, the Word class has been created to represent a word in the game,
 and the WordQueue class extends the Queue<Word> class to create a queue of words for the game.
 The WordFactory class provides a factory method for creating Word objects,
 so that future modifications to the Word class can be easily handled
.A simple unit test for the Word class has also been included using a testing framework, such as XUnit.
